# Boris Tvaroska

Technical Lead at Google. 25+ years translating technology into business value. 
MBA and MS in Computer Science.

After 30+ enterprise AI implementations and countless side-projects, I've learned that boring, practical approaches beat flashy demos every time.

My focus: helping large organizations act like startups in the AI area, at least. One can always hope.
